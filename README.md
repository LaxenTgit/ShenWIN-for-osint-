## What's shenwin
# shenwin

Shenwin is a Python-based OSINT username enumeration tool inspired by Sherlock and other reconnaissance utilities. It is designed to unify multiple OSINT approaches into a single workflow, enabling broader and faster username discovery across online platforms.

The tool checks username availability and presence across a large number of services while also extending search coverage through username variation generation. These variations include prefixes, suffixes, numeric patterns, and leetspeak transformations, allowing deeper reconnaissance beyond a single static username query.

Shenwin can also integrate OSINT tooling workflows on Windows environments via Winget support, making it more adaptable for multi-platform reconnaissance setups. Its multi-threaded architecture improves performance by running parallel checks across many services simultaneously.

The main goal of Shenwin is to enhance username-based OSINT investigations by combining enumeration, variation generation, and multi-source verification into a single lightweight Python tool.

In summary, Shenwin provides a unified and extensible approach to username reconnaissance, improving both coverage and efficiency in OSINT operations.
